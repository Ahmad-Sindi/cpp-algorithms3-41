# Algorithm Challenge #41 – Reverse Words in a String (Level 3)

🧠 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a full line of text from the user and reverses the **order of its words**,  
while keeping the characters inside each word unchanged.

This challenge focuses on understanding **string processing**, **data structures**,  and **reverse traversal logic** in C++.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- How to split strings into words using delimiters
- Using vectors to store dynamic data
- Iterating through containers in reverse order
- Writing clean, modular, and readable C++ functions
- Thinking in terms of data transformation instead of raw output

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**  
Enter String:  
Ali Abdullah Fahad Makkah  

**Output:**  
Makkah Fahad Abdullah Ali

📂 File Information
-
- **Language:** C++  
- **File Name:** reverse_words_string.cpp  
- **Challenge Level:** 3  
- **Challenge Number:** #41

💬 Notes
-
This problem highlights an important engineering concept:

> Data should be transformed logically, not manipulated randomly.

Instead of reversing characters, the solution treats each word as a data unit,
which improves clarity, scalability, and maintainability.
